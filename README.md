## Prerequisites

Before using this extension, you'll need:

- This extension installed (steps below)
- NFC Tools app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749))

## Installation

### Manual Installation (Developer Mode)
1. Download or clone this repository (by pasting this into your terminal):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trywait/YotoTools.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the directory containing the extension files
6. Once loaded, click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions) in Chrome's toolbar
7. Find "Yoto Tools" in the dropdown list
8. Click the pin icon next to it to keep it visible in your toolbar (optional)

## Usage

### Step 1: Get Your Card's URL
1. Install NFC Tools on your mobile device:
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tools/id1252962749) (requires iPhone 7 or newer, iOS 15.6+)
   - [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc)
2. Open NFC Tools and scan your Yoto card
3. Look for "Record 1" in the scan results
4. Find the URL that looks like: `yoto.io/ABC123?xxxxxxx=yyyyyyyy`
5. Copy or note down this URL

### Step 2: Access the Card Page
1. On your computer (not phone), open Chrome
2. Paste the `yoto.io` URL you found in Step 1
3. The URL will redirect to the official Yoto card page
4. Wait for the page to fully load

### Step 3: Use the Extension
1. Once on the card page (after it redirects), you'll see download buttons directly on the screen:
   *Note: Do not refresh this page as it will lead to a 404 error. If this happens, simply return to Step 1.4 and re-enter the original `yoto.io` URL.*
   - **Save Complete Backup**: Downloads all card content into an organized folder
   - **Save Card Details**: Saves a text file with the card's information
   - **Save Card Artwork**: Downloads the card's cover art
   - **Save Audio / Save Audio**: Downloads that specific track audio or icon
   
2. You can also click the Yoto Tools extension icon in your Chrome toolbar for quick actions.

Both methods will save your files in the same organized way, so you can use whichever is more convenient.

### Step 4: Locate Your Backups
1. By default, files are saved to your computer's Downloads folder
2. A new folder will be created named after your card (e.g., "Jack and the Beanstalk")
3. Inside the folder, you'll find:
   - Audio files named: `Track 1 - [Title].mp4`, `Track 2 - [Title].mp4`, etc.
   - Chapter/Track images named: `Image 1 - [Track Title].jpg`, `Image 2 - [Track Title].jpg`, etc. (if available)
   - Cover artwork named: `Cover Art - [Card Title].jpg`
   - Card information saved as: `[Card Title] - Details.txt`
4. All files are automatically organized and numbered in the order they appear on the card

*Note: Audio files are downloaded in .mp4 format. For better compatibility with media players and devices, you may want to convert them to .mp3 format. We recommend using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)) or another audio conversion tool of your choice to process the files.*

### Important Notes
- Always ensure you're backing up cards you own
- Keep your backups secure and for personal use only
- The extension works on official Yoto card pages matching these patterns:
  - `https://play.yotoplay.com/*/card/*`
  - `https://share.yoto.co/*`
- Make sure to keep your NFC Tools app updated
